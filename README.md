## Introduction
Ever had a call scheduled with a VC and wanted to ask them for an intro, but didn't know whom they are closely connected with in the crypto space? 

Introducing **Coinvestooor** ✨ – a tool designed to help you navigate the interconnected world of crypto venture capital.

## Known Issues
• The app is super scrappy since I put it all together within a few hrs.
• There's still some issue with the formatting.

## Why Coinvestooor?
During fundraising I faced this issue the first time around, I always knew I had to ask the VC for intro but I never knew whom would be the best person to ask.
This was also the case when I was a VC - I met other VCs but was unsure of whom best to ask!
